I don't even use linux, why is this here?

What even are dotfiles?!

Yeah so tbh I have no idea I just did something and im not sure if this repo counts as dotfiles but I put some time in it and I feel like it looks nice so in my opinion it counts.

# What is this?
I guess this is my rice for arch linux (GNOME) but I think this works on Ubuntu or anything else that can run GNOME awell.

This repo has all the data, from theming to extensions and the wallpaper and one installer script.

# Getting started
Run the following command to download the installer script and run it.
``` 
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TuinboonDev/.files/refs/heads/main/setup.sh && chmod +x setup.sh && ./setup.sh
```
After that please reboot your system or relog.
